### Day 1: April 23, 2017 (Autoquiz)

**Today's Progress**: 
* set up a project wiki, and project management board on github
* set up a landing page for the tool

**Thoughts:** 
* curious about the best folder structure. I'm sure things could be done in a better way, but I'm going to do whatever is necessary to keep progressing without letting these decisions hold me back. It's best to just document the decision and move on, and come back to it if things aren't working.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
